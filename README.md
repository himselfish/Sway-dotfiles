# Welcome to the .dotfiles of my Archlinux Gruvbox themed Sway setup

After using a combination of various other dotfiles from generous people on Github, combined with my own adjustments, I decided to share my current setup too. Also, many thanks to the kind internetstrangers at <A HREF="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">r/unixporn</A> for their wonderful creations.
I'm running Archlinux with Sway as my window manager. I used the "gruvbox" colors as much as possible.

This repository contains my dotfiles in a .tar file which you can extract to your ~/.config folder.

I also added a file called packages.txt containing all the packages I currently have installed.  If I ever break my system it can be a useful list to have.
