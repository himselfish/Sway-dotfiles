# Welcome to the .dotfiles of my Archlinux Sway setup

After using a combination of various other dotfiles from generous people on Github, combined with my own adjustments, I decided to share my current setup too. Also, many thanks to the kind internetstrangers at r/unixporn for their wonderful creations.
I'm running Archlinux with Sway as my window manager. I used the "gruvbox" colors as much as possible.

This repository contains my dotfiles in a .tar file which you can extract to your ~/.config folder.

I also added a file called packages.txt containing all the packages I currently have installed.  If I ever break my system it can be a useful list to have.

# Show me!
